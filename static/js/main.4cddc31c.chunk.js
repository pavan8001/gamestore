From emerald-green national forests to the incredible red rock formations jutting up from the earth at Garden of the Gods, you\u2019ll find it nearly impossible to resist taking the time out of delivering loads to explore the natural beauty this state has to offer. Don\'t miss out on a viewpoint in Ouray, the Switzerland of America, which gives you a beautiful view of this Victorian-era mining town!<br/><br/>The state is especially famous for its Rocky Mountains, however, much of the eastern part of the region is dominated by a unique grassland that  extends across the American continent. The Great Plains is an area that stretches more than eighteen hundred miles from north to south of North America and more than five hundred miles from east to west.<h2 class=\\"bb_tag\\">Million Dollar Highway</h2><br/><img src=\\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1209471/extras/million_dollar_highway.jpg?t=1605220918\\"><br/><br/>Offering views of mountains, valleys and gorges, the Million Dollar Highway is a road like no other. Stretching for around 25 miles (40 km) on the U.S. Highway 550, it has been said that it\'s one of the nation\u2019s most spectacular drives. The highway delivers jaw-dropping vistas and stunning backdrops on its winding and often dangerous road.<br/><br/>So why is this stretch of road named the Million Dollar Highway? There are several stories including that it cost a million dollars a mile to build it and that its fill dirt contains a million dollars in gold ore.<h2 class=\\"bb_tag\\">Industries</h2><br/><img src=\\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1209471/extras/industries.jpg?t=1605220918\\"><br/><br/>Speaking about gold, the state is known for its gold mine located near Colorado Springs where you can haul important mining equipment and waste rock to and from the mining site. Colorado is also home to a variety of bottling plants, each producing and distributing an assortment of different beverages which drivers can deliver to locations across the States.<br/><br/>Being a state that promotes its natural beauty, Colorado is always looking at ways of using clean energy to protect the environment. With unique parts and equipment always on the move from the number one wind turbine factory in the USA to wind farms across the States, we hope you will be a <i>BIG fan</i> of this industry.<br/><br/>Nearly half of the state\'s 66 million acres are dedicated just to farms and ranches. Play a key role in contributing to this important economy and exporting the state\'s produce across the States. From hay bales to farming equipment, truckers will be the backbone of making sure this important and large industry in <i>Cowowado</i> keeps on <i>moo-vin\'</i>!<br/><br/>One of the largest contributors to the local economy is Denver International Airport. Drivers can expect to see lots of details around the airport including Denver\'s famous horse statue. Truckers can also deliver to and from a fan-favorite cargo drop off point, located in the inside of a large cargo aircraft.<h2 class=\\"bb_tag\\">Cities</h2><br/><img src=\\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1209471/extras/cities.jpg?t=1605220918\\"><br/><br/>Nicknamed the Mile High City, Denver features accurate representations of famous landmarks and industries for drivers to discover and deliver cargo to. Denver will also feature a realistic road network, including the famous \\"mousetrap intersection\\", the interchange of I-25 and I-70, which is best known for its spaghetti-like design.<br/><br/>Located at the foot of Pikes Peak, you\'ll find the city of Colorado Springs, the state\'s 2nd most populous city. Colorado Springs is known for its many one-of-a-kind attractions, the most iconic being the city\'s Garden of the Gods Park, a National Natural Landmark. Featuring 300 million years worth of geological history and incredible towering red sandstone rock formations, it is no wonder it is ranked top of the list of best parks to visit in the US. Try to find a hidden road that will take you there!\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</img></img></img></img></div>","system_req":"<div class=\\"game_page_autocollapse sys_req\\" style=\\"max-height: 300px;\\">\\n<h2>System Requirements</h2>\\n<div class=\\"sysreq_tabs\\">\\n<div class=\\"sysreq_tab active\\" data-os=\\"win\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWindows\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n<div class=\\"sysreq_tab\\" data-os=\\"mac\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMac OS X\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n<div class=\\"sysreq_tab\\" data-os=\\"linux\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSteamOS + Linux\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n<div style=\\"clear: left;\\"></div>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\"sysreq_contents\\">\\n<div class=\\"game_area_sys_req sysreq_content active\\" data-os=\\"win\\">\\n<div class=\\"game_area_sys_req_leftCol\\">\\n<ul>\\n<strong>Minimum:</strong><br/><ul class=\\"bb_ul\\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 7 64-bit<br/></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Dual core CPU 2.4 GHz<br/></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4 GB RAM<br/></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> GeForce GTS 450-class (Intel HD 4000)<br/></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 190 MB available space</li></ul> </ul>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\"game_area_sys_req_rightCol\\">\\n<ul>\\n<strong>Recommended:</strong><br/><ul class=\\"bb_ul\\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 7/8.1/10 64-bit<br/></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Quad core CPU 3.0 GHz<br/></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 6 GB RAM<br/></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> GeForce GTX 760-class (2 GB)<br/></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 190 MB available space</li></ul> </ul>\\n</div>\\n<div style=\\"clear: both;\\"></div>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\"game_area_sys_req sysreq_content\\" data-os=\\"mac\\">\\n<div class=\\"game_area_sys_req_leftCol\\">\\n<ul>\\n<strong>Minimum:</strong><br/><ul class=\\"bb_ul\\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Mac OS X 10.9 (Mavericks)<br/></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Dual core CPU 2.4 GHz<br/></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4 GB RAM<br/></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> GeForce GTS 450-class (Intel HD 4000)<br/></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 190 MB available space</li></ul> </ul>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\"game_area_sys_req_rightCol\\">\\n<ul>\\n<strong>Recommended:</strong><br/><ul class=\\"bb_ul\\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Mac OS X 10.10 (Yosemite)<br/></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Quad core CPU 3.0 GHz<br/></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 6 GB RAM<br/></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> GeForce GTX 760-class (Intel HD 5300)<br/></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 190 MB available space</li></ul> </ul>\\n</div>\\n<div style=\\"clear: both;\\"></div>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\"game_area_sys_req sysreq_content\\" data-os=\\"linux\\">\\n<div class=\\"game_area_sys_req_leftCol\\">\\n<ul>\\n<strong>Minimum:</strong><br/><ul class=\\"bb_ul\\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit<br/></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Dual core CPU 2.4 GHz<br/></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4 GB RAM<br/></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> GeForce GTS 450-class (Intel HD 4000)<br/></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 190 MB available space</li></ul> </ul>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\"game_area_sys_req_rightCol\\">\\n<ul>\\n<strong>Recommended:</strong><br/><ul class=\\"bb_ul\\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit<br/></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Quad core CPU 3.0 GHz<br/></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 6 GB RAM<br/></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> GeForce GTX 760-class (2 GB)<br/></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 190 MB available space</li></ul> </ul>\\n</div>\\n<div style=\\"clear: both;\\"></div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>","name":"American Truck Simulator -

From emerald-green national forests to the incredible red rock formations jutting up from the earth at Garden of the Gods, you\u2019ll find it nearly impossible to resist taking the time out of delivering loads to explore the natural beauty this state has to offer. Don\'t miss out on a viewpoint in Ouray, the Switzerland of America, which gives you a beautiful view of this Victorian-era mining town!<br/><br/>The state is especially famous for its Rocky Mountains, however, much of the eastern part of the region is dominated by a unique grassland that  extends across the American continent. The Great Plains is an area that stretches more than eighteen hundred miles from north to south of North America and more than five hundred miles from east to west.<h2 class=\\"bb_tag\\">Million Dollar Highway</h2><br/><img src=\\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1209471/extras/million_dollar_highway.jpg?t=1605220918\\"><br/><br/>Offering views of mountains, valleys and gorges, the Million Dollar Highway is a road like no other. Stretching for around 25 miles (40 km) on the U.S. Highway 550, it has been said that it\'s one of the nation\u2019s most spectacular drives. The highway delivers jaw-dropping vistas and stunning backdrops on its winding and often dangerous road.<br/><br/>So why is this stretch of road named the Million Dollar Highway? There are several stories including that it cost a million dollars a mile to build it and that its fill dirt contains a million dollars in gold ore.<h2 class=\\"bb_tag\\">Industries</h2><br/><img src=\\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1209471/extras/industries.jpg?t=1605220918\\"><br/><br/>Speaking about gold, the state is known for its gold mine located near Colorado Springs where you can haul important mining equipment and waste rock to and from the mining site. Colorado is also home to a variety of bottling plants, each producing and distributing an assortment of different beverages which drivers can deliver to locations across the States.<br/><br/>Being a state that promotes its natural beauty, Colorado is always looking at ways of using clean energy to protect the environment. With unique parts and equipment always on the move from the number one wind turbine factory in the USA to wind farms across the States, we hope you will be a <i>BIG fan</i> of this industry.<br/><br/>Nearly half of the state\'s 66 million acres are dedicated just to farms and ranches. Play a key role in contributing to this important economy and exporting the state\'s produce across the States. From hay bales to farming equipment, truckers will be the backbone of making sure this important and large industry in <i>Cowowado</i> keeps on <i>moo-vin\'</i>!<br/><br/>One of the largest contributors to the local economy is Denver International Airport. Drivers can expect to see lots of details around the airport including Denver\'s famous horse statue. Truckers can also deliver to and from a fan-favorite cargo drop off point, located in the inside of a large cargo aircraft.<h2 class=\\"bb_tag\\">Cities</h2><br/><img src=\\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1209471/extras/cities.jpg?t=1605220918\\"><br/><br/>Nicknamed the Mile High City, Denver features accurate representations of famous landmarks and industries for drivers to discover and deliver cargo to. Denver will also feature a realistic road network, including the famous \\"mousetrap intersection\\", the interchange of I-25 and I-70, which is best known for its spaghetti-like design.<br/><br/>Located at the foot of Pikes Peak, you\'ll find the city of Colorado Springs, the state\'s 2nd most populous city. Colorado Springs is known for its many one-of-a-kind attractions, the most iconic being the city\'s Garden of the Gods Park, a National Natural Landmark. Featuring 300 million years worth of geological history and incredible towering red sandstone rock formations, it is no wonder it is ranked top of the list of best parks to visit in the US.

The nights grow colder and the days grow darker, as Dracula builds his bloodthirsty army of mindless thralls. Only the hunters Dr. Abraham Van Helsing, Dr. John Seward, Mina Harker and Lord Arthur Godalming stand against the advancing evil. But as the sun sets on Europe, can they survive long enough to stop the encroaching darkness?</i><br/><img src=\\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/958530/extras/1the-hunt.gif?t=1605268578\\"><br/><i>Fury of Dracula: Digital Edition</i> is the digital adaptation of the much-loved board game, first published in 1987 by Games Workshop. Based on the 4th Edition of the game, this faithful adaptation allows you to re-experience this iconic game of gothic horror and deduction in a whole new way. If you\u2019ve never played the original board game, you can see exactly why <i>Fury of Dracula</i> is considered a classic among the board game community!<br/><br/>Will you take on the role of Dracula as he increases his influence over Europe? Or will you and up to three friends take on the role of Dr. Abraham Van Helsing, Dr. John Seward, Lord Arthur Godalming, and Mina Harker as they attempt to stop him before his bloody plans bear fruit? <br/><img src=\\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/958530/extras/1Dracula_stalks.gif?t=1605268578\\"><br/><i>Fury of Dracula</i> is a game that emphasizes hidden movement and teamwork, with the hunters having to coordinate their movements to close the net on Dracula. Dracula has a host of tricks and traps up his sleeves, to misdirect and hide from the hunters - but the hunters are armed with plenty of tools too! Each hunter provides a new way to play, with unique stats and abilities to aid them in the fight against this ancient evil.<br/><br/>Dracula himself has a range of unholy powers to call upon, allowing him to transform and enthral humans, along with transforming into a bat or mist in order to escape the hunters.<br/><br/>Once the hunters and Dracula finally clash, bloody and gruesome combat ensues. Nobody is safe as Dracula lashes out at his pursuers, and the hunters battle against the inhuman and immortal Count. Featuring a card-based combat system that rewards bluffing and tactical choices, no two clashes are the same.<br/><img src=\\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/958530/extras/1will-you-survive.gif?t=1605268578\\"><h2 class=\\"bb_tag\\">Feature List:</h2><ul class=\\"bb_ul\\"><li><strong>Detailed Tutorial</strong> Designed with care, our in-depth tutorials will walk you through everything you need to know to start your hunt.<br/></li><li><strong>A Faithful Adaptation</strong> Based on the 4th Edition of the physical game, Fury of Dracula: Digital Edition recreates the iconic board game in its entirety.<br/></li><li><strong>Multiple Game Modes</strong> Choose from battling against the AI, teaming up with friends locally or taking the hunt global with 1v1 online battles.<br/></li><li><strong>Detailed Card Library</strong> Browse everything Fury of Dracula has to offer in our detailed library, including character, combat and event cards to prepare yourself.<br/></li><li><strong>Haunting Animations</strong> The artwork from the original board game bursts to life with beautiful and bloody animations for every single piece.<br/></li><li><strong>A Chilling Soundtrack</strong> Composed and created from the ground up for Fury of Dracula: Digital Edition, this soundtrack is sure to send chills down your spine - also available as a standalone purchase!<br/></li><li><strong>Planned Content</strong> Because we\u2019re a very small indie team, we don\u2019t want to sink our fangs into too much work at once.

It is your job to ensure the complete and total destruction of your enemies, while you do all in your power to prevent enemy retaliation against your peace-loving citizens.<br/><br/><img src=\\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1178220/extras/ICBM-ifyouwantpeace.jpg?t=1605025042\\"><br/>Research and develop your nuclear arsenal. Will you focus on developing new technologies, or mass producing existing ones? It takes a true strategist to research and build a balanced force that can deal with a multitude of enemy tactics.<br/><br/><img src=\\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1178220/extras/ICBM-manyroadstovictory.jpg?t=1605025042\\"><br/>In ICBM, you can try out different strategies every time you play. Will you overwhelm your enemy with intercontinental ballistic missiles? Use bombers to deliver massive payloads? Or maybe use submarines to deliver nukes from the least expected locations? These strategies and more can all be used to ensure victory. ICBM has 20 unit types and 12 nuclear weapon types to use, plus 44 technologies to explore.<br/><br/><img src=\\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1178220/extras/ICBM-adjustthegamespeed.jpg?t=1605025042\\"><br/>Take the time to carefully plan your next move, or just nuke your opponents as fast as you can. Increase the contamination speed for a swift and painless nuclear war, or slow it down for an endless nightmare. In ICBM, you can constantly adjust the game speed to your own pace.<br/><br/><img src=\\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1178220/extras/ICBM-forgealliances.jpg?t=1605025042\\"><br/>Use diplomacy to gain strategic advantages. Share information, technologies or even the location of your nukes with your allies to wage war against common enemies. Be aware however that these alliances do not have to last and you might find yourself fending off attacks by your former friends. <br/><br/><img src=\\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1178220/extras/ICBM-createsaveandexecute.jpg?t=1605025042\\"><br/>Reduce micro-management by making use of the strike planner.

There are multiple ways to ensure the first person on Mars is under your command. Every choice matters: will you invest in the most advanced technology or take risks in the rush to the red planet?<br/><br/>Using actual events and missions as inspiration, can you handle the challenges faced by real space agencies?<br/><br/><img src=\\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/765810/extras/Journey_to_Mars_EN.gif?t=1605015835\\"><br/><br/>Management is a vital aspect of Mars Horizon. You\'ll need to design and build the right spacecraft, hire and train the crew, and make strategic decisions as mission control to survive the journey to Mars.<br/><br/>Enter into diplomatic partnerships with other agencies to share the rewards of space exploration, or risk going it alone to gain greater prestige. Construct the ideal rocket from historically-inspired vehicle parts. Hire contractors to construct vehicles and use their unique benefits to gain a key edge over your competitors.<br/><br/><img src=\\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/765810/extras/Face_the_challenges_EN.gif?t=1605015835\\"><br/><br/>Launching a payload into space is only the first step.

But beware: space is a very unforgiving environment.<br/><br/>These are the critical moment-to-moment decisions of mission control; do you spend power to fix a malfunctioning antenna or save it in case of an oxygen leak? Perhaps risking that extra three months of mission planning could have avoided this issue?<br/><br/><img src=\\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/765810/extras/Supported_by_ESA_EN_-_Blue_Logo.gif?t=1605015835\\"><br/><br/>Mars Horizon has been made with the input and support of the European Space Agency (ESA) and the UK Space Agency.<br/><br/>We\u2019ve collaborated with numerous experts in space exploration from the ESA in creating Mars Horizon.

Only the hunters Dr. Abraham Van Helsing, Dr. John Seward, Mina Harker and Lord Arthur Godalming stand against the advancing evil. But as the sun sets on Europe, can they survive long enough to stop the encroaching darkness?</i><br/><img src=\\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/958530/extras/1the-hunt.gif?t=1605268578\\"><br/><i>Fury of Dracula: Digital Edition</i> is the digital adaptation of the much-loved board game, first published in 1987 by Games Workshop. Based on the 4th Edition of the game, this faithful adaptation allows you to re-experience this iconic game of gothic horror and deduction in a whole new way. If you\u2019ve never played the original board game, you can see exactly why <i>Fury of Dracula</i> is considered a classic among the board game community!<br/><br/>Will you take on the role of Dracula as he increases his influence over Europe? Or will you and up to three friends take on the role of Dr. Abraham Van Helsing, Dr. John Seward, Lord Arthur Godalming, and Mina Harker as they attempt to stop him before his bloody plans bear fruit? <br/><img src=\\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/958530/extras/1Dracula_stalks.gif?t=1605268578\\"><br/><i>Fury of Dracula</i> is a game that emphasizes hidden movement and teamwork, with the hunters having to coordinate their movements to close the net on Dracula. Dracula has a host of tricks and traps up his sleeves, to misdirect and hide from the hunters - but the hunters are armed with plenty of tools too! Each hunter provides a new way to play, with unique stats and abilities to aid them in the fight against this ancient evil.<br/><br/>Dracula himself has a range of unholy powers to call upon, allowing him to transform and enthral humans, along with transforming into a bat or mist in order to escape the hunters.<br/><br/>Once the hunters and Dracula finally clash, bloody and gruesome combat ensues. Nobody is safe as Dracula lashes out at his pursuers, and the hunters battle against the inhuman and immortal Count. Featuring a card-based combat system that rewards bluffing and tactical choices, no two clashes are the same.<br/><img src=\\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/958530/extras/1will-you-survive.gif?t=1605268578\\"><h2 class=\\"bb_tag\\">Feature List:</h2><ul class=\\"bb_ul\\"><li><strong>Detailed Tutorial</strong> Designed with care, our in-depth tutorials will walk you through everything you need to know to start your hunt.<br/></li><li><strong>A Faithful Adaptation</strong> Based on the 4th Edition of the physical game, Fury of Dracula: Digital Edition recreates the iconic board game in its entirety.<br/></li><li><strong>Multiple Game Modes</strong> Choose from battling against the AI, teaming up with friends locally or taking the hunt global with 1v1 online battles.<br/></li><li><strong>Detailed Card Library</strong> Browse everything Fury of Dracula has to offer in our detailed library, including character, combat and event cards to prepare yourself.<br/></li><li><strong>Haunting Animations</strong> The artwork from the original board game bursts to life with beautiful and bloody animations for every single piece.<br/></li><li><strong>A Chilling Soundtrack</strong> Composed and created from the ground up for Fury of Dracula: Digital Edition, this soundtrack is sure to send chills down your spine - also available as a standalone purchase!<br/></li><li><strong>Planned Content</strong> Because we\u2019re a very small indie team, we don\u2019t want to sink our fangs into too much work at once.

Hero Swing features multiple game modes allowing players to simulate their own ultimate swinging hero experience.<h2 class=\\"bb_tag\\"><strong>GAME MODES</strong></h2><br/>The current version of Hero Swing VR features five game modes easily accessible from hero\'s apartment. Each game mode has multiple difficulty levels to accommodate the needs of both novice and experienced players.<h2 class=\\"bb_tag\\"><u>DISTANCE MODE</u></h2><br/><img src=\\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1021890/extras/Animated_GIF-distance.gif?t=1605197200\\"><br/><br/>Distance Mode is the \\"vanilla\\" experience of Hero Swing VR. The goal is very simple, to cover as much distance as possible without touching the ground. Swing through the air, wall jump and avoid obstacles all while feeling the rush. This is an arcade high score driven game mode where the score will increase both with the distance covered and by performing various tricks.<br/>Distance mode comes in many variations such as Standard, Rooftop and Digital World.<h2 class=\\"bb_tag\\"><u>CHASE MODE</u></h2><br/><img src=\\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1021890/extras/Animated_GIF-chase.gif?t=1605197200\\"><br/><br/>Chase Mode was the logical continuation of our original \u201cvanilla\u201d experience. If we made swinging through a city possible why not also chase down bad guys? Welcome to the Chase Mode where the goal  is to catch the bad guys making a fast getaway after a robbery. The robbers have various getaway vehicles  such as cars, trucks and helicopters and each has its own pros and cons. It\'s up to the player to put his hero skills to the ultimate test.<h2 class=\\"bb_tag\\"><u>SWING&amp;GUN</u></h2><br/><img src=\\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1021890/extras/Animated_GIF-sag.gif?t=1605197200\\"><br/><br/>The Swing&amp;Gun arcade mode puts the player in a virtual \\"Tron\\" inspired environment in order to fight off waves of robotic monsters. This mode combines both swinging and shooting mechanics and the result is fast paced adrenaline action. <br/>Use 6 different weapons and face both swarms of drones and giant robots. Just like our other modes Swing&amp;Gun requires the player to keep on the move by rewarding movement with ammo  replenishment.<h2 class=\\"bb_tag\\"><u>VIRTUAL GOLF</u>:</h2><br/><img src=\\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1021890/extras/9.gif?t=1605197200\\"><br/><br/>We wanted to make specific challenges for the achievement room but then it turned out that it was a very fun and relaxing game mode that could be played with friends using only one headset. That\'s when we made Virtual Golf a game mode that is designed to be both a challenge new and old players and is multiplayer \\"hot-seat\\" friendly. Players will have use a limited amount of swings to successfully navigate our 12 hole course, its basically Golf but in VR, with force gauntlets...<h2 class=\\"bb_tag\\"><u>TRAINING MODE</u>:</h2><br/><img src=\\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1021890/extras/8.gif?t=1605197200\\"><br/><br/>If you ever want to just relax in a comic book city and swing around then this is the game mode for you. No objectives, no stress, just enjoy the impressive skyline Hero city has to offer. Unless you are up for a challenge? Then partake in various challenge course in time trial mode.<h2 class=\\"bb_tag\\"><strong>ROADMAP FOR FULL RELEASE:</strong></h2><h2 class=\\"bb_tag\\"><u>CORE GAME IMPROVEMENTS:</u></h2>We are happy with how our game looks and plays but we had certain higher standards in mind for our full release. Before the full release we are working on the following:<br/><ul class=\\"bb_ul\\"><li>improving the graphics<br/></li><li>optimizing the game to run better on PC<br/></li><li>optimizing controls (we would like to create multiple control presets that would fit the needs of both newer and more experienced players)<br/></li><li>expand existing game modes and challenges</li></ul><h2 class=\\"bb_tag\\"><u>KAIJU MODE:</u></h2>This mode is what we had in mind when creating the Swing and Shoot game mode and mechanics. We always wanted the player to swing around a 300m tall Monster that is attacking the city. As it rampages through the skyline it\'s up to the Hero to dodge, swing and shoot at the Kaiju to save the city. <br/>As big fans of Kaiju movies we could not sit idle and not make this game mode. It\'s still in very early alpha but we would love to make a fully fledged game mode out of it with insanely difficult achievements.<h2 class=\\"bb_tag\\"><strong>EXTRA ROADMAP:</strong></h2>This part of the Roadmap is what we would love to do with the game if the game is well received. Developing  a virtual reality game is money and time consuming and the following features are very time intensive. Originally we hoped to have those game modes included in the full release but it turned out that we underestimated the momentous task of making VR content. If by any chance Hero Swing VR is well received by the community so it covers our business expenses we will work to add the following game modes as Free DLC-post release:<h2 class=\\"bb_tag\\"><u>STORY MODE:</u></h2>We would like to create a lighthearted superhero story that combines various elements from other game modes in creating a integrated seamless experience.<br/>This particular mode is imagined as a very large expansion/addition for Free mode where player would move around the city and once when they feel like it, start story missions.<h2 class=\\"bb_tag\\"><u>MULTIPLAYER:</u></h2>The ultimate vision for Hero Swing VR always had multiplayer features. As have been noted earlier, if the game acceptance exceeds our expectations, we will be granted an opportunity to make this mode and to further spice up  and enrich the heroic flavor this game provides.<br/>We would like to make at least three core game modes: Race, Combat and Coop. <br/>The race mode would be similar to other light hearted kart racing games where players fight while completing laps around the course. We believe that the distance mode could serve as a great course for racing other players and fighting them mid air. <br/>Combat mode is imagined as a 3v3 mode where players  swing and shoot in standard shooter game such  as, for example,  team death match, search and destroy or capture the flag.<br/>Coop mode was imagined to allow players to enjoy story mode from above with friends.<br/>After all, wouldn\'t it be amazing to participate in  this adventure simultaneously  with your friends?<br/><br/><br/><img src=\\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1021890/extras/ogo2.png?t=1605197200\\"><h2 class=\\"bb_tag\\"><strong>ABOUT CUBICLE INTERACTIVE</strong></h2>Our lifelong passion for video games and digital entertainment brought us together first as friends, and then as colleagues. What once was a mere hobby is now  our full time commitment.<br/>Cubicle Interactive began as a playtime project in Unreal engine. Our goal was to develop an adrenaline filled experience inspired by our childhood heroes, but as development went on we realized that Hero Swing could truly become an amazing game. That is when we transitioned to work full time on this project and after another year of development it was time to involve the community in order to finish Hero Swing VR. <br/>That is how Cubicle and Hero Swing VR came to life, our attempt to share the ultimate swinging experience.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</img></img></img></img></img></img></div>","system_req":"<div class=\\"game_page_autocollapse sys_req\\" style=\\"max-height: 300px;\\">\\n<h2>System Requirements</h2>\\n<div class=\\"sysreq_contents\\">\\n<div class=\\"game_area_sys_req sysreq_content active\\" data-os=\\"win\\">\\n<div class=\\"game_area_sys_req_leftCol\\">\\n<ul>\\n<strong>Minimum:</strong><br/><ul class=\\"bb_ul\\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br/></li><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 10<br/></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core i5-4590<br/></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 8 GB RAM<br/></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970<br/></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 8 GB available space</li></ul> </ul>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\"game_area_sys_req_rightCol\\">\\n<ul>\\n<strong>Recommended:</strong><br/><ul class=\\"bb_ul\\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br/></li><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 10<br/></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core i7-4770<br/></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 16 GB RAM<br/></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980 Ti<br/></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 8 GB available space</li></ul> </ul>\\n</div>\\n<div style=\\"clear: both;\\"></div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>","name":"Hero Swing VR","platforms":["win","hmd_separator","valveindex","htcvive","oculusrift"],"price":419},"15004":{"video_link":"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/256807340/movie480.mp4?t=1603979153","poster":"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/256807340/movie.293x165.jpg?t=1603979153","thumbnails":["https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/256807340/movie.184x123.jpg?t=1603979153","https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1037380/ss_f06f14a4b7498abe4fdd5a1f7a2292259816514f.116x65.jpg?t=1604070909","https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1037380/ss_d5318390e8b338656e88a95afeb70c314df2c35d.116x65.jpg?t=1604070909","https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1037380/ss_d31d4dab375228be09e84d70861d7db05f15aaa0.116x65.jpg?t=1604070909","https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1037380/ss_ab87944c349d51340ef108c9f5114ffeeca4dc91.116x65.jpg?t=1604070909","https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1037380/ss_3e5ff1dd343c705c36520fc5c7dac4221121c99b.116x65.jpg?t=1604070909"],"about":"<div class=\\"game_area_description\\" id=\\"game_area_description\\">\\n<h2>About This Game</h2>\\n<strong><h2 class=\\"bb_tag\\">JOIN OUR COMMUNITY ON DISCORD</h2></strong><br/><a href=\\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://discord.gg/pyAJNDC\\" rel=\\"noopener\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><img src=\\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1037380/extras/Steam_Discord_Link_3.png?t=1604070909\\"/></a><h2 class=\\"bb_tag\\">Virtual reality island of sins</h2><br/>It\u2019s 3 vs. 3!

Instead, pace fluctuates randomly moment to moment and you are free to destroy most beams with whichever hand you\'d like.

Increase the number of hits you can take, the length of your blades, the damage caused by your energy waves, or even the time-dilation that occurs when you take damage. Earn credits even on a loss, so there\'s never a reason to go back in difficulty - continue to push yourself and face ever intensifying challenge! Additionally, clearing levels unlocks equipment modules that enhance or alter your abilities.<h2 class=\\"bb_tag\\"><strong>\u2022Unlock New Abilities</strong></h2>Choose your loadout and use your credits to enhance its effectiveness! Will you create a force-field that reduces damage when you restore your health? Or will you temporarily slow time? Gain the ability to throw your swords, or switch one out for a blaster!

Find your favorite place.<br/><br/>You can control time of day, music, sounds, dialog, walking speed, and graphics detail.<br/><img src=\\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1441690/extras/Menu__8_6_2016_-_reduced.png?t=1604958957\\"><h2 class=\\"bb_tag\\">Controls</h2><img src=\\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1441690/extras/Controls_-_Smaller.png?t=1604958957\\"><h2 class=\\"bb_tag\\">Why</h2>I wrote ZendoVR in 2016 as an idea I had for VR and meditation.

We are the remnants of desire. We are the deprived and the humiliated. Those at the top, they shudder at the mere thought of breathing the same air as us\u2026 But what\'s ironic is that the reason that this world is so beautiful, the reason it is so insane, the reason it is so worth living is because they can\'t get rid of us, and they never will. Look through the prism of my eyes, of my life, and perhaps you will be able to see a world entirely different from the one in your imagination; but, then again maybe you were right all along? Then you\'re crazy, just like me.<br>\\n<br>\\r\\n\xb7You\'ve most likely never come across a card game with such an extensive plot before.<br>\\r\\nA plot with hundreds of thousands of words, and it is no bedtime story at that. All the goings on in Starcity are as crazy as it gets! Take on the role of a band of lawless rebels in this strange gargantuan cyberpunk city with battle and adventure around every corner! The city also hosts dozens of lurking informants: find them, take on the missions they give, and bring the city under your control!<br>\\n<br>\\r\\n\xb7Companions, each with unique abilities and complex personalities.<br>\\r\\nThe story features more than 10 characters, each with distinct personalities and unique decks. Take companions with you to confront challenges ranging from robot guards to labyrinths of the mind! Want to storm the CEO offices to the accompaniment of explosions, to sneak past guards or take out opponents with a well-honed slash of your sword? The decision is yours!<br>\\n<br>\\r\\n\xb7Cards perfectly complement the plot.<br/>\\r\\nExploring the city will open the map up to you and the city itself is full of uncharted opportunities, with each step along the way bringing about changes to your deck. No matter whether it\'s wounds from the battlefield, psychological suffering, allies\' assistance or a gang\'s hit list, they may all become cards in your deck, granting your battles a whole-new level of unpredictability. Each choice you make has a chance of showing up as a card, bringing victory to you\u2014or to your opponent.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>","system_req":"<div class=\\"game_page_autocollapse sys_req\\" style=\\"max-height: 300px;\\">\\n<h2>System Requirements</h2>\\n<div class=\\"sysreq_contents\\">\\n<div class=\\"game_area_sys_req sysreq_content active\\" data-os=\\"win\\">\\n<div class=\\"game_area_sys_req_leftCol\\">\\n<ul>\\n<strong>Minimum:</strong><br/><ul class=\\"bb_ul\\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 7/8/10 64-bit<br/></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> 3.2 GHz Dual Core Processor<br/></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4 GB RAM<br/></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> GeForce GTX 660, Radeon R7 370 or equivalent with 2 GB of video RAM<br/></li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 11<br/></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 2 GB available space<br/></li><li><strong>Sound Card:</strong> DirectX compatible</li></ul> </ul>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\"game_area_sys_req_rightCol\\">\\n<ul>\\n<strong>Recommended:</strong><br/><ul class=\\"bb_ul\\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 7/8/10 64-bit<br/></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> 3.2 GHz Quad Core Processor<br/></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 8 GB RAM<br/></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> GeForce 970, Radeon RX 580 or equivalent with 4GB of video RAM<br/></li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 11<br/></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 2 GB available space<br/></li><li><strong>Sound Card:</strong> DirectX compatible</li></ul> </ul>\\n</div>\\n<div style=\\"clear: both;\\"></div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>","name":"Shadowplay: Metropolis Foe / \u5f71\u5b50\u6e38\u620f\uff1a\u661f\u57ce\u884c\u52a8","platforms":["win"],"price":296},"22005":{"video_link":"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/256808455/movie480.mp4?t=1604945747","poster":"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/256808455/movie.293x165.jpg?t=1604945747","thumbnails":["https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/256808455/movie.184x123.jpg?t=1604945747","https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/256799341/movie.184x123.jpg?t=1598933644","https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/256789134/movie.184x123.jpg?t=1592082797","https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/256735997/movie.184x123.jpg?t=1542776326","https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/964800/ss_6cbe1a5df192391cf47415e5e6f60776b6a52915.116x65.jpg?t=1604957322","https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/964800/ss_6cda213621eca599a7a66ab7dba2ce29c401cc63.116x65.jpg?t=1604957322","https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/964800/ss_32e66ce858cab74a7da38d566101f2631c998fff.116x65.jpg?t=1604957322","https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/964800/ss_0b5eb4e2bc4b8a111933d5b4c84b11c1c192290c.116x65.jpg?t=1604957322","https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/964800/ss_b4c230a9a6a3244a29ad8b1642029d5d560cba5d.116x65.jpg?t=1604957322","https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/964800/ss_604e605553221959018f7782d0a77663e49be392.116x65.jpg?t=1604957322","https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/964800/ss_7f1cb100c553cf1cbae3d0406c639a8d830a116d.116x65.jpg?t=1604957322","https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/964800/ss_6055bcbdc6c9eb1c2e2b2ebd9dcf4a3791b2a304.116x65.jpg?t=1604957322","https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/964800/ss_fcfd1f98aec9902f096602f26ae2b92e2253c8c4.116x65.jpg?t=1604957322","https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/964800/ss_688e48e7b3e73493405d76609badb28c07d9a33b.116x65.jpg?t=1604957322","https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/964800/ss_4ed199232c22444455eeb7f2308f4fbadb02bc63.116x65.jpg?t=1604957322","https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/964800/ss_5e240fe62d9eb0266fc77486ab28c6a08d568c86.116x65.jpg?t=1604957322"],"about":"<div class=\\"game_area_description\\" id=\\"game_area_description\\">\\n<h2>About This Game</h2>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tProdeus is a first-person shooter of old, re-imagined using modern rendering techniques.

As you explore the furthest reaches of space and encounter various factions, all vying for power, the character you decide to become will determine how this player-driven story unfolds. In the corporate equation for the colony, you are the unplanned variable. <br/><br/><strong>KEY FEATURES</strong><h2 class=\\"bb_tag\\">The player-driven story RPG</h2>In keeping with the Obsidian tradition, how you approach The Outer Worlds is up to you. Your choices affect not only the way the story develops; but your character build, companion stories, and end game scenarios.<br/><br/><br/><img src=\\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/578650/extras/TOW_The_player-driven_story_RPG.gif?t=1604678659\\"><h2 class=\\"bb_tag\\">You can be flawed, in a good way</h2>New to The Outer Worlds is the idea of flaws. A compelling hero is made by the flaws they carry with them. While playing The Outer Worlds, the game tracks your experience to find what you aren\'t particularly good at. Keep getting attacked by Raptidons? Taking the Raptiphobia flaw gives you a debuff when confronting the vicious creatures, but rewards you with an additional character perk immediately. This optional approach to the game helps you build the character you want while exploring Halcyon.<br/><br/><br/><img src=\\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/578650/extras/TOW_You_can_be_flawed,_in_a_good_way.gif?t=1604678659\\"><h2 class=\\"bb_tag\\">Lead your companions</h2>During your journey through the furthest colony, you will meet a host of characters who will want to join your crew. Armed with unique abilities, these companions all have their own missions, motivations, and ideals.

Your quest is help beautiful girls to defeat monsters. <br/>Let\'s make the girl feeling happy.

She is pretty short, but despite that, nothing scares her and she can talk back to anyone. The girl only teases the people that mean something to her and that\'s what happens with the protagonist too.<br/>She has a great business and is one of the best talents regarding potions, but never brags about it. The girl knows that people don\'t take her seriously because of her looks, but she managed to show them how imposing she is by her hard work.<br/><br/><img src=\\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1418160/extras/Sana.png?t=1604688677\\"><br/>Sana is a elf warrior but that\'s not what her whole personality revolves around. Despite her stern look, she is a person that values life more than anything and thinks it is better to retreat sometimes from fights and try again than to die a hero.<br/>She is a smart, strong woman that has some love for humans and other people, despite them being against her kind. She knows Rena and that helps her trust the mc more since he came from her.<br/><br/><img src=\\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1418160/extras/Georgia.png?t=1604688677\\"><br/>Georgia is a strong woman, both physically and mentally. She leads a bunch of men in her blacksmith shop and doesn\'t respond to anyone. She is a very important person and the best in the town, making weapons and armors for the king and people close to him.<br/>She lost a close friend in a battle but doesn\'t tell anyone about it. Since then, she swore to not participate anymore in these sorts of things. Although she makes items that kill people, she doesn\'t see all battles as something that should never exist but more like a necessary evil. <br/><br/><img src=\\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1418160/extras/Angami.png?t=1604688677\\"><br/>Angami is a strong but weird naga warrior. She has to watch over the MC but despite that being an inconvenience for her, she barely complains about it.<br/>She has to train the recruits all over the kingdom and despite her tough look, she loves to joke around and tease, especially with people close to her. The woman is older than the mc by twelve years but no one else knows that about her. She started this by helping Georgia, but warmed up to the protagonist and even bring him food from her place.<br/><br/><img src=\\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1418160/extras/Yuna.png?t=1604688677\\"><br/>Yuna is a cheeky succubus that only hunts the best guys in the town. Despite her sexy attitude, she is overwhelmed by the MC\'s kindness and falls in love for the first time in her long life. She is made to attract people so that was never a problem for her, so she can\'t explain how the protagonist managed to refuse her advances in the first night.<br/>She is almost never serious, but gets interested in what humans do and even cooks for the mc as a gesture of gratitude. Yuna tries to tease the protagonist but always falls short, getting embarrassed and ending up being the one that gets teased more.<br/><br/><br/><strong>FEATURES </strong><br/>\u2765 Fun and challenge match-3 gameplay.<br/>\u2765 Upgradeable Stats, Skills.<br/>\u2765 More than 50 animated enemies.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</img></img></img></img></img></div>","system_req":"<div class=\\"game_page_autocollapse sys_req\\" style=\\"max-height: 300px;\\">\\n<h2>System Requirements</h2>\\n<div class=\\"sysreq_contents\\">\\n<div class=\\"game_area_sys_req sysreq_content active\\" data-os=\\"win\\">\\n<div class=\\"game_area_sys_req_leftCol\\">\\n<ul>\\n<strong>Minimum:</strong><br/><ul class=\\"bb_ul\\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Window 10<br/></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core 2 Dual or AMD Equivalent<br/></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 1 GB RAM<br/></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> DirectX 9 Compatible Graphics Card<br/></li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 9.0<br/></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 200 MB available space</li></ul> </ul>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\"game_area_sys_req_rightCol\\">\\n<ul>\\n<strong>Recommended:</strong><br/><ul class=\\"bb_ul\\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> Window 10<br/></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core 2 Dual or AMD Equivalent<br/></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 2 GB RAM<br/></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> DirectX 9 Compatible Graphics Card<br/></li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 9.0<br/></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 500 MB available space</li></ul> </ul>\\n</div>\\n<div style=\\"clear: both;\\"></div>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n</div>","name":"Happy Quest","platforms":["win"],"price":59},"25003":{"video_link":"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/256771860/movie480.mp4?t=1597823918","poster":"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/256771860/movie.293x165.jpg?t=1597823918","thumbnails":["https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/256771860/movie.184x123.jpg?t=1597823918","https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1194700/ss_694ae9c7cad8313b9b5a21f0fdc12fc6886ce31e.116x65.jpg?t=1604786586","https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1194700/ss_821c100f1b65d59a17275cf487143f042e9c4ecf.116x65.jpg?t=1604786586","https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1194700/ss_e28dbba20eee03ee6e643ba57a78464c7cc01ba0.116x65.jpg?t=1604786586","https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1194700/ss_ff0599e8e0d64d282b04906bdd1dd56a2dded306.116x65.jpg?t=1604786586","https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1194700/ss_e036f506ba497380f6e5f6b3e01038b4a9b8521d.116x65.jpg?t=1604786586","https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1194700/ss_e2094dd9d79c8ba6f90e9b03d429fe43e6e576a3.116x65.jpg?t=1604786586","https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1194700/ss_f382a2356b80387ccbd7b4469ce98fc0b9186dc3.116x65.jpg?t=1604786586","https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1194700/ss_fac0a9ba2fd4d2b22cad23adbae9d7aa30883d56.116x65.jpg?t=1604786586","https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1194700/ss_48f92af073353fbe958b7fd39d039a981e52d266.116x65.jpg?t=1604786586","https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1194700/ss_d603f71db2bffa525b4d15c1cb15f4dcd6c7039d.116x65.jpg?t=1604786586","https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1194700/ss_677b6251c9b1d8ac06775d90a11c968eb74967fe.116x65.jpg?t=1604786586"],"about":"<div class=\\"game_area_description\\" id=\\"game_area_description\\">\\n<h2>About This Game</h2>\\n<img src=\\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1194700/extras/1_en_US.gif?t=1604786586\\"><br/><br/>We have ensured that House Flipper VR brings a unique experience, no matter if you ever tried virtual renovations.

We like to make sure we can do all the crazy stuff we want -- while ensuring everything runs smoothly on devices from PCs &amp; next-generation consoles to mobile phones (and maybe toasters in the

As you explore the furthest reaches of space and encounter various factions, all vying for power, the character you decide to become will determine how this player-driven story unfolds. In the corporate equation for the colony, you are the unplanned variable. <br/><br/><strong>KEY FEATURES</strong><h2 class=\\"bb_tag\\">The player-driven story RPG</h2>In keeping with the Obsidian tradition, how you approach The Outer Worlds is up to you. Your choices affect not only the way the story develops; but your character build, companion stories, and end game scenarios.<br/><br/><br/><img src=\\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/578650/extras/TOW_The_player-driven_story_RPG.gif?t=1604678659\\"><h2 class=\\"bb_tag\\">You can be flawed, in a good way</h2>New to The Outer Worlds is the idea of flaws. A compelling hero is made by the flaws they carry with them. While playing The Outer Worlds, the game tracks your experience to find what you aren\'t particularly good at. Keep getting attacked by Raptidons? Taking the Raptiphobia flaw gives you a debuff when confronting the vicious creatures, but rewards you with an additional character perk immediately. This optional approach to the game helps you build the character you want while exploring Halcyon.<br/><br/><br/><img src=\\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/578650/extras/TOW_You_can_be_flawed,_in_a_good_way.gif?t=1604678659\\"><h2 class=\\"bb_tag\\">Lead your companions</h2>During your journey through the furthest colony, you will meet a host of characters who will want to join your crew. Armed with unique abilities, these companions all have their own missions, motivations, and ideals. It\'s up to you to help them achieve their goals, or turn them to your own ends.<br/><br/><br/><img src=\\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/578650/extras/TOW_Lead_your_companions.gif?t=1604678659\\"><h2 class=\\"bb_tag\\">Explore the corporate colony</h2>Halcyon is a colony at the edge of the galaxy owned and operated by a corporate board.

The nights grow colder and the days grow darker, as Dracula builds his bloodthirsty army of mindless thralls. Only the hunters Dr. Abraham Van Helsing, Dr. John Seward, Mina Harker and Lord Arthur Godalming stand against the advancing evil. But as the sun sets on Europe, can they survive long enough to stop the encroaching darkness?</i><br/><img src=\\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/958530/extras/1the-hunt.gif?t=1605268578\\"><br/><i>Fury of Dracula: Digital Edition</i> is the digital adaptation of the much-loved board game, first published in 1987 by Games Workshop. Based on the 4th Edition of the game, this faithful adaptation allows you to re-experience this iconic game of gothic horror and deduction in a whole new way. If you\u2019ve never played the original board game, you can see exactly why <i>Fury of Dracula</i> is considered a classic among the board game community!<br/><br/>Will you take on the role of Dracula as he increases his influence over Europe? Or will you and up to three friends take on the role of Dr. Abraham Van Helsing, Dr. John Seward, Lord Arthur Godalming, and Mina Harker as they attempt to stop him before his bloody plans bear fruit? <br/><img src=\\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/958530/extras/1Dracula_stalks.gif?t=1605268578\\"><br/><i>Fury of Dracula</i> is a game that emphasizes hidden movement and teamwork, with the hunters having to coordinate their movements to close the net on Dracula. Dracula has a host of tricks and traps up his sleeves, to misdirect and hide from the hunters - but the hunters are armed with plenty of tools too! Each hunter provides a new way to play, with unique stats and abilities to aid them in the fight against this ancient evil.<br/><br/>Dracula himself has a range of unholy powers to call upon, allowing him to transform and enthral humans, along with transforming into a bat or mist in order to escape the hunters.<br/><br/>Once the hunters and Dracula finally clash, bloody and gruesome combat ensues. Nobody is safe as Dracula lashes out at his pursuers, and the hunters battle against the inhuman and immortal Count. Featuring a card-based combat system that rewards bluffing and tactical choices, no two clashes are the same.<br/><img src=\\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/958530/extras/1will-you-survive.gif?t=1605268578\\"><h2 class=\\"bb_tag\\">Feature List:</h2><ul class=\\"bb_ul\\"><li><strong>Detailed Tutorial</strong> Designed with care, our in-depth tutorials will walk you through everything you need to know to start your hunt.<br/></li><li><strong>A Faithful Adaptation</strong> Based on the 4th Edition of the physical game, Fury of Dracula: Digital Edition recreates the iconic board game in its entirety.<br/></li><li><strong>Multiple Game Modes</strong> Choose from battling against the AI, teaming up with friends locally or taking the hunt global with 1v1 online battles.<br/></li><li><strong>Detailed Card Library</strong> Browse everything Fury of Dracula has to offer in our detailed library, including character, combat and event cards to prepare yourself.<br/></li><li><strong>Haunting Animations</strong> The artwork from the original board game bursts to life with beautiful and bloody animations for every single piece.<br/></li><li><strong>A Chilling Soundtrack</strong> Composed and created from the ground up for Fury of Dracula: Digital Edition, this soundtrack is sure to send chills down your spine - also available as a standalone purchase!<br/></li><li><strong>Planned Content</strong> Because we\u2019re a very small indie team, we don\u2019t want to sink our fangs into too much work at once.

It is used by hundreds of thousands of gamers worldwide to connect and play popular games such as Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, Savage Worlds, Call of Cthulhu, and so many more. This type of program is commonly referred to as a \u2018virtual tabletop\u2019, or VTT, due to their ability to emulate various parts of an RPG session in digital form.<br/>While you can play ANY game on Fantasy Grounds, these available systems allow you to buy preloaded content that is ready to go. Less prep time for the GM means more playtime for the players and a more enjoyable online experience overall.<br/>Even for those wanting to run their games in person, Fantasy Grounds helps keep all your information handy and helps keep the game moving along at a fast pace. <br/>With cross-platform play, Fantasy Grounds users can play with users on Steam or with a mixed group of users on Mac, Windows PC, and Linux platforms across the world and different time zones.<br/>Available as a lifetime purchase, or as a monthly subscription. You can also try a free demo!<h2 class=\\"bb_tag\\">What\u2019s New with Fantasy Grounds Unity:</h2><br/><ul class=\\"bb_ul\\"><li>64-bit support to allow for more content (quality and quantity)<br/></li><li>Native support for Mac, Linux and Windows PC<br/></li><li>Network lobby for easy hosting and joining of games (no port forwarding required)<br/></li><li>Tile based map building with built-in support for dynamic Line of Sight<br/></li><li>Enhanced Drawing Tools<br/></li><li>Additional Dice Macros support<br/></li><li>A new FGU only skin<br/></li><li>Dynamic Line of Sight with enhanced toggle blockers for walls, doors, terrain and secret areas.<br/></li><li>Paint with images, such as walls<br/></li><li>Animated image effects<br/></li><li>Locally stored Asset Library for use in campaigns<br/></li><li>Backward compatibility with all existing campaigns and DLC from FGC</li></ul><br/>In addition to these features, we are now poised to add even greater functionality going forward.

Teardown features a fully destructible and truly interactive environment where player freedom and emergent gameplay are the driving mechanics.<br/><br/>Tear down walls with explosives or vehicles to create shortcuts no one thought was possible. Stack objects, build structures, or use floating objects to your advantage. Take your time to create the most efficient path through the level and get ready to run.<br/><br/>The moment you pick up your first target, an alarm goes off, and the heat is on. Run, jump, drive, slingshot, do whatever you need to collect all of the targets, and escape before security arrives.<br/><br/><strong>Game modes</strong><br/><strong>Campaign</strong><br/>With your company pressured by increasing debt, you start accepting work from some more or less shady individuals. Soon you are knee-deep in a murky soup of revenge, betrayal, and insurance fraud.

Upgrade your expanding arsenal of tools by searching for hidden valuables scattered around the environments.<br/><br/><strong>Sandbox</strong><br/>Play around in the various environments with the tools you have unlocked.
